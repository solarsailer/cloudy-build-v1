Warning: the files in `lib` are JS files that **are not** compiled. Node handles most of the ES6 features, except imports. And because we cannot use `import`, the files are not strict by default. We need to preface them with `'use strict'` too.

## TODO

Maybe we should add a compilation step here in the future. Maybe ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
